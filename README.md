# C-Jacks-or-Better
Jacks or Better mini project made in C++.
Look at 'README' text file to read up on rules and how to play game.
To play the game, the application and C++ main file must be in the same folder. Further improvements to the application would be to separate the functions into another file instead of having it all in one.
